# ARM64 system register helper tool
This tool takes the parameters of an MRS / MSR instruction and outputs the system register name.

Currently it's set up as a command-line utility, but I want to make it a hex-rays script to replace the ARM64_SYSREG() output.

# How to use
python translate_syreg.py $op0 $op1 $CRn $CRm $op2

# Making modifications
The code is autogenerated from tables given in the ARM Architecture Reference Manual.
Some registers are missing, notably anything used for the cache, and PSTATE calls. I'll get around to adding them eventually.
Likewise, many descriptions are missing as I haven't found a good resource to extract them from yet.

Generator code is given in the "generators" folder, so you can generate your own if you wish.
The code is very hacky, sorry, but it's a pretty simple tool.
Please feel free to contribute to the descriptions.txt and table.txt files!
